**[Teaser/Abstract]**  

<br>

As Figure 1 indicates, the rapid development of the mRNA technology is manifested in an increasing number of patent applications relative to all pharma patent applications at the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/" target ="blank">US patent office (USPTO)</a> in the past several years. This surge in innovation is likely one reason why mRNA based vaccines against Covid-19 have been developed at a record pace. The success of the mRNA technology in vaccinating against Covid-19 could now lead to new breakthroughs in other areas as well, particularly in cancer therapy.

Against this background, the question arises which research hubs are mainly responsible for developing this (possibly) breakthrough medical treatment technology of the future. In order to check which country-level pharma eco-systems are the most active ones in developing the mRNA technology, we plot the share of mRNA based patent applications in a country’s overall pharmaceutical patent applications filed at the <a href=https://www.patentsview.org target = “_blank”>USPTO</a>.

#### **Figure 2: Germany has a strong focus on mRNA based technologies**

Three interesting conclusions may be drawn from Figure 2. First, the Western world drives the mRNA-patenting activity compared to big Asian research hubs. Second, until 2014, the USA had the largest (relative to domestic pharma patents) share of mRNA based patent applications at the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/" target ="blank">USPTO</a>. Third, since 2015, Germany’s pharmaceuticals have strongly profiled their pharma patent applications portfolio towards mRNA technology, becoming world-wide the industry that is most focused on developing and patenting mRNA based technologies. Nonetheless, the USA remains the largest mRNA patenting hub where roughly 60% of all <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/" target ="blank">USPTO</a> mRNA patent applications are developed (you can investigate this in the Figure 2 by choosing Share in total mRNA). However, Germany is rapidly catching up over the last three years.  

<div class=bloc_div>
<blockquote>***Germany’s pharmaceuticals have strongly focused on developing and patenting mRNA based technologies***</blockquote>

<br>

In addition to the aggregated country perspective, it is utterly important to identify and acknowledge the world’s leading pharmaceutical organizations in the field of mRNA technology. The following graph presents the 15 firms and universities with the largest number of filed mRNA patent applications at the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/" target ="blank">USPTO</a> between 2012 and 2020. 

<br>

#### **Figure 3: Universities play a significant role in mRNA patent applications**

<br>

Most patent applications were filed by Curevac and Moderna, both appeared as vaccine developers during the Covid-19 pandemic, even though only Moderna's ultimately got an approval. 

<div class=bloc_div>
<blockquote>***Universities are very active in mRNA-related patent applications***</blockquote>
</div>

Novartis takes a very high 3rd place which indicates that Swiss pharmacists possess a high scientific interest and know-how when it comes to mRNA research and development. Another very interesting observation is that universities are very active in mRNA-related patent applications, which highlights the importance of academic research for the emergence of new technologies.
